# ST NFC Sensor

This repository contains the ST NFC Sensor app source code.

The ST NFC Sensor application, available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/st-nfc-sensor/id1377274569?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.smartTag), shows the data exported by sensor nodes via the NFC protocol.

It allows you to configure and read data from any system running the [FP-SNS-SMARTAG1](http://www.st.com/en/product/fp-sns-smartag1) function pack (for example, the [STEVAL-SMARTAG1](http://www.st.com/en/product/steval-smartag1) evaluation board).

You can configure the app by choosing the sampling intervals, the sensor data logged and the conditions to trigger data logging.

After configuration, the app shows data in informative plots, identifies significant events, such as high acceleration and changes in orientation, and exports data to a
csv file.

The embedded [ST25DV](http://www.st.com/st25dv) series Dynamic NFC Tag energy harvesting feature allows
using the [STEVAL-SMARTAG1](http://www.st.com/en/product/steval-smartag1) without a battery and reading sensor data in one shot
mode.
